Title: The Rise of WoofWorks Mega Compute System
Date: 1984
Summary:
    The WoofWorks Mega Compute System, originally designed for space-bound calculations and top-secret doggy analytics, was
    born from an ambitious project started in 1984. Its initial purpose was to calculate the optimal trajectory for dog
    satellite launches. Later repurposed for advanced canine AI research, the Mega Compute System became integral to WoofWorks'
    early advancements in machine learning. However, rumors persist about a "lost component" within the system—an
    intelligence file referred to as "Project Barkwave." This file was said to be so advanced that it could predict canine
    behavior with alarming accuracy, possibly surpassing even WoofWorks' highest expectations...
